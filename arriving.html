<!-- <h1>Arriving</h1>

<h3>Have your papers ready</h3>
<p>When arriving at your destinationa aiport you will be required to do a quick interview to complete your visa process.
Make sure you have everything ready and all the necessary documents in a folder. This will relieve your stress during the interview. Canadian airport officials will be glad you came prepeared.
Don't forget to pay the ETA fee before you arrive in Canada otherwise you might not gain entry into Canada</p>
<h3>Figure out how to get to your location</h3>
<p>Canada has an excellent transport system so it shoudln't be too difficult getting around. Cities like Toronto are well equipped and there are a variety of options. Buses and trains are generally located at the airport if you are heading towards a downtown area.
If you're located further out, you can use Uber or Lyft which can be quite cheap compared to taxis. Don't foget to download these apps would you have an available Wifi connection if you havent done so already.</p>
<h3>Start getting the basics ready</h3>
<p>It's best you start getting organised as soon as you can. Go to a phone shop and get a new phone or phone number. Canada is known for it's expensive phone plans but there are some cheap networks like Fido or Freedom.
  Certain banks won't let you open a bank account when you first arrive however there are some that do. TD is a great option for new arrivals and it's great bank to get started with. Make sure you collect your Social Insurance Number(SIN) from your main city hall. This is important when applying for jobs and searching for accomodation.</p>
<h3>Take a break(if you can)</h3>
<p>Try and take a break if you can and take in the new scenery of Canada. It can be overwhelming trying to settle so make sure you take time to unwind and do some site seeing. Canada has so much to offer with great restaurants, shops, sporting events and festivals.</p> -->
