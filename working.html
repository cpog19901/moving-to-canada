<!-- <h1>Working</h1>
<h3>Convert your CV to a resume</h3>
<p>Make sure you prepare a resume for yourself before you arrive in Canada. Make sure you update your resume with your new phone number and be sure to have CV in a Canadian resume format. I highly recomment bringing a laptop with on your move to Canada. It will make your life a hell of a lot easier for you.</p>
<h3>Make use of recruitment agencies</h3>
<p>It may be difficult to get a response from a lot of employers when you do not have any Canadian work experience on your resume. Job agencies are a great place to get your foot in the door. Although a lot of jobs advertised may be offering a low wage, it's still a great way to keep money coming in. Remember that no job is forever and you can change once you have build up some Canadian work experience. </p>
<h3>Networking and Social Media</h3>
<p>Irish expats are always posting listing for workers particularly in the trade workforce. Irish and New in Toronto is an excellent place to start. Another great way of getting potential work is network and join a sporting team or social meetup. Many Irish expats join GAA, Hurling and soccer teams to socialise and make new friends. This can be a great oppertunity to network and ask around about potential work. </p>
<h3>Be willing to try other types of work</h3>
<p>If you are finding it difficult to get a job particularly if you work in social care and medicine, be prepared to try something temporary to keep yourself afloat. Certain job sectors have a long vetting period or require certain certification to obtain work. There are lots of temp position available in Canada. Don't get too worried if your having difficulty and be patient.</p> -->
