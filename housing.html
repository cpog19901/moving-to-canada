<!-- <h1>Housing</h1>
<h3>Social Media can really help</h3>
<p>Sites like Facebook can really assist in your housing search. Be sure to join Irish and New in Toronto group on Facebook. People from the Irish community are constantly advertising rooms, houses and apartments for rent. This will be your best option when searching for accomodation(Also a great place to ask about jobs!)
If you came to Toronto with a group it may not be as beneficial but it will cetainly help people who have arrived on their own or couples.</p>
<h3>Search advertising sites</h3>
<p>Another option is to search advertising boards such as Kijiji, Padmapper and Rentals.ca. These sites are great for choosing specific areas and narrowing down your search. Be careful for scammers and make sure the person posting is legitimate. You may see posts that are too good to be true, e.g very nice apartments for very low rental fees. Have your wits about you when using these sites.</p>
<h3>Downtown can be more expensive</h3>
<p>If you havent saved too much money for your Canadian travels make sure to stick to places away from the downtown area. It can very expensive the closer you are to the main city, so it is best to search the surrounding areas. If you don't plan on driving make sure you look for rentals close to transport and shops. </p>
<h3>Certain things may go against you</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that a lot of landlords who advertise rentals in Canada will require people with a good credit rating. You will probably have to face some rejection when doing your apartment hunting but don't let it deter you. On top of this if you haven't found any work while since you have arrive it may hurt you too. To improve your chance I would recommend getting a job before you start searching for housing. It may not be possible depending how long you have booked in your hotel or hostel.
